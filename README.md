# econ191-thsr-house-price

This repo is dedicated to my ECON 191 project on the THSR housing price effect. The folders in this repo include:

`01DoFiles`: contains the Stata do-files. 

`02DoArchives`: contains the old Stata do-files. (can actually be deleted since I'm already on GitHub, but I'll procrastinate)

`11Input`: contains the raw data and the processed input data for the project. 

`12Temp`: contains intermediate data for further processing.

`13Output`: contains graphs and tables for the final result.
