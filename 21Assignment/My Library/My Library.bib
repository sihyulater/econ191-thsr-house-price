	abstract = {An important challenge in the crime literature is to isolate causal effects of police on crime. Following a terrorist attack on the main Jewish center in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in July 1994, all Jewish institutions received police protection. Thus, this hideous event induced a geographical allocation of police forces that can be presumed exogenous in a crime regression. Using data on the location of car thefts before and after the attack, we find a large deterrent effect of observable police on crime. The effect is local, with no appreciable impact outside the narrow area in which the police are deployed.},

	abstract = {This paper estimates the impact of climate change on the prevalence of criminal activity in the United States. The analysis is based on a panel of monthly crime, temperature, and precipitation data for 2,972 U.S. counties over the 50-year period from 1960 to 2009. I identify the eﬀect of weather on monthly crime by using a semi-parametric bin estimator and controlling for county-by-month and county-by-year ﬁxed eﬀects. The results show that temperature has a strong positive eﬀect on criminal behavior, with little evidence of lagged impacts. Under the IPCC’s A1B climate scenario, the United States will experience an additional 35,000 murders, 216,000 cases of rape, 1.6 million aggraved assaults, 2.4 million simple assaults, 409,000 robberies, 3.1 million burglaries, 3.8 million cases of larceny, and 1.4 million cases of vehicle theft, compared to the total number of oﬀenses that would have occurred between the years 2010 and 2099 in the absence of climate change. The present discounted value of the social costs of these climate-related crimes is between 20 and 68 billion dollars.},

While there is a long-standing history of scholarly interest in the weather-crime association, the last decade has evidenced a marked increase in the volume and diversity of empirical studies concerned with weather and its social implications including crime. In this paper we conduct a review of the empirical literature on weather and crime. This is the first review on the topic for more than 30 years. We highlight the theoretic and empirical challenges that persist and act to impede our understanding and chart four interrelated thematic areas that require concerted attention. These are to: (1) strengthen and integrate theoretical explanations of the weather-crime association; (2) model multi-dimensional processes of the weathercrime association; (3) broaden the situational, climatic, and cultural contexts of study; and (4) to translate research into policy and practice. We conclude by advocating for scholarship to advance the four thematic areas such that we progress towards a more complete and robust understanding of the weather-crime association.},

They depicted this relationship by plotting temperature against assault. This plot, however, fails to take into account time of day. Time of day was strongly related to both temperature and assault, but in opposite directions. Between 9:00 p.m. and 2:59 a.m. of the next day, when most assaults occurred, there was a positive linear relationship between temperature and assault. The Minneapolis data actually provide stronger support of a positive linear (or monotonic) relationship between temperature and assault than of an inverted U-shaped relationship.},

The first was based on areaaveraged temperatures in the United States as a whole for the years 1950 through 1999. Box-Jenkins time-series analyses indicated that annual temperatures were associated with assault but not murder rates in analyses that controlled for yearly population, ethnicity, and three economic variables. The second analysis was based on state-centered crime rates from 1960 through 1998 and included the same controls. Contrary to the general aggression model, cross-sectional time-series analyses indicated that annual temperatures were associated with rates for assault, rape, robbery, burglary, and larceny, but not murder or motor vehicle theft. The results are consistent with a routine activity theory interpretation of everyday and criminal behavior.},

We identify a significant accessibility premium well before the tunnel is completed. There is also a change in market structure of increased preference for residential property in areas closer to the tunnel, reflected by higher price appreciation.

Estimating effect size is a primary purpose of a meta-analysis. Effect size was calculated in 2007 by using pre-2003 studies but has not been studied since. This study sought to fill gaps in the literature by conducting a regression analysis and a thorough meta-analysis that reviewed 114 studies published from 1976 to 2014. Of 114 U.S. and Canadian single-family studies, a sample of 45 single-family studies was selected for further analysis. Compared with the previous meta-analysis, the current analysis found that, overall, U.S. and Canadian studies reported lower premiums on average for single-family houses. The average single-family home premium of 2.3\% was significantly lower than the 4.2\% premium calculated by the previous meta-analysis. It was found that reported transit premiums were decreasing over time as more variables, such as walkability of station areas, were statistically controlled. It was also found that compact regions with greater accessibility via transit produced higher transit premiums and transit premiums were neutral with respect to technology (light versus heavy rail) once regional compactness was controlled for. These findings suggest that to get the most out of transit investments, planners and public officials must make an effort to create compact regional development patterns and that single-family housing may not be the best use in areas close to transit.},

As the construction of infrastructure often lasts for years, it is plausible to assume that investors will take expected improvements into consideration when pricing and trading neighbourhood properties. However, there have been few investigations of such effects. This paper is an empirical study of whether premiums were paid for the expected benefits offered by a new tunnel before its completion. The results showed that there were positive price expectation effects well before the completion of the tunnel. The expectation effects allow the government to finance infrastructure projects by selling land in the affected districts in advance.},

	abstract = {The literature on land and property values demonstrates a great deal of variability in the estimated change in values arising from rail investments. This paper conducts a meta-analysis on empirical estimates from 23 studies (102 observations) that analysed the impact of rail on land/property value changes. Variation in the estimated impacts is calculated and discussed in relation to key dimensions of study-design characteristics. The results show that a number of factors produce signiﬁcant variations in the estimates. These include the type of land use, the type of rail service, the rail system life cycle maturity, the distance to stations, the geographical location, accessibility to roads, methodological characteristics, as well as whether the impacted area is land or property. On the other hand, we observe that changes in purchase price and rent values due to rail projects are statistically similar to each other, that there is no evidence of change in values over time nor due to the location of land/property within the city, and that including property characteristics and neighbourhood type in the estimation model do not change values signiﬁcantly. Publication bias tests are also performed and show that although researchers tend to report both positive and negative results, they tend to be biased towards statistically signiﬁcant estimates.},

	abstract = {Accessibility to transit facilities is perceived to affect property prices. However, accessibility by transit has rarely elicited adequate scholarly attention in property price analyses. Additionally, previous studies on how transit accessibility affects property prices mainly focused on rail and bus rapid transit systems, while conventional bus transit, which is very popular in many contexts, has seldom been investigated. Moreover, whether there is spatial heterogeneity in the price (or capitalization) effects of conventional bus accessibility remains to be explored. To fill these gaps, this study aims to investigate the role of accessibility to and by bus in determining housing prices in a bus-dependent city where urban transit service is offered mainly by a bus system rather than other transit systems. Using a database of 4966 condominium units in Xiamen, China, this study develops a battery of spatial econometric models to estimate global and local relationships between to-bus and by-bus accessibility and housing prices. The findings are as below: (1) to-bus accessibility (measured by the number of nearby bus stops) is positively associated with nearby housing prices; (2) by-bus accessibility (measured by travel time to city centers by bus and bus frequency) significantly affects nearby housing prices; (3) spatial heterogeneity exists in the price effects of bus accessibility; and (4) bus frequency exerts a larger price effect in the peripheral area than in the central. Finally, practical and policy implications are discussed.},

	abstract = {High-speed rail is a large-scale form of public infrastructure that delivers obvious public beneﬁts and economic externalities. The effects of high-speed rail on housing prices are signiﬁcant, generating positive effects such as increased accessibility between cities as well as negative impacts such as noise pollution. The development of housing projects and urban spaces that surround high-speed rail stations can be improved by scientiﬁcally examining the effects of high-speed rail stations on housing prices. In examining the Beijing high-speed rail station, this study develops a hedonic model to study the effects of a high-speed rail station on housing prices at varying geographical spatial ranges. Research shows that greater accessibility between cities, increased investment attractiveness, and an expansion of public service infrastructure results from the establishment of high-speed rail stations, which in turn positively affects housing prices. However, trafﬁc congestion, electromagnetic radiation pollution, noise, and higher crime rates negatively affect housing prices. Spatial variations in housing prices result from the combined effects of positive and negative impacts. From the research result that housing price increases with an decline in distance between houses and high-speed rail stations within (0.891 km, 11.704 km) by the inﬂuence of high-speed rail station, and thus we recommend that residential land-transferring fee premiums resulting from high-speed rail station construction should be dedicated to the construction of affordable housing. In addition, housing price declines with an decline in distance between houses and high-speed rail stations within (0.475 km, 0.891 km), and thus regarding negative impacts of high-speed rail stations on housing prices, we recommend that compensation be made available to homeowners residing in affected regions. While land use intensities and urban space layouts should be considered during the planning of high-speed rail stations.},

However, potential changes in these effects with regard to short-run and long-run equilibriums have not been studied satisfactorily in developing countries. Therefore, this paper measures the effect of metro railway line investments on housing sale prices with respect to two different stages of related projects: pre-construction stage and postconstruction stage, in two similar study areas in I˙stanbul, Turkey. The prices of houses are modeled using he­ donic price models. The results indicate that housing sale prices before construction (announcement) of the metro railway line projects increase almost twofold after construction. In addition, the paper employs a before and after analysis to measure the effect of the different stages of metro railway line investments on housing sale prices. The results reveal that the average price increase of a housing unit in the pre-construction phase of the metro railway line project is 86,756.37 TL greater than the average price increase in the post-construction phase. Thus, the validity of the speculated effect of such urban railway investments on housing sale prices is justified.},

To identify the effects of Shinkansen, we examine, separately and jointly, the entire system as it evolved over time under different economic conditions. We construct a prefecture-level dataset for Japan with macroeconomic and sociodemographic variables, as well as information on the opening and operation of each Shinkansen line. The evidence suggests that high-speed rail has a negative impact on prefecture land prices and population growth, and it increases urbanization. Evidence of high-speed rail induced urban expansion increasing housing affordability and reducing urban density is found.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this research is to estimate the effects of highway development projects on the price of housing. Transportation development projects, highways in particular, improve a certain area’s accessibility but also increase its levels of exposure to trafﬁc intensity and noise pollution. These externalities are evaluated by homeowners and residents and are reﬂected in the price of housing. In this paper, we use several repeat sales model speciﬁcations, including difference-in-differences estimators, and control for neighborhood effects to examine housing price trends in the municipalities around two newly developed highways in the Netherlands. The results of the research demonstrate that changes in accessibility result in a signiﬁcant positive effect on the price of housing in nearby municipalities, but that increased noise pollution and trafﬁc intensity levels result in a decrease in prices. The ﬁndings also conﬁrm that combining the total effects of all externalities, the effect of highway development on the price of housing is generally positive, and this effect is salient even before the project is completed due to public anticipation effects.},

	abstract = {We estimate spatial hedonic price functions to examine local and regional accessibility beneﬁts of commuter rail service in Eastern Massachusetts, while controlling for proximity-related negative externalities and other confounding inﬂuences. The data include 1,860 single-family residential properties from four municipalities with commuter rail service, and three municipalities without commuter rail service. We ﬁnd some evidence of the capitalization of accessibility to commuter rail stations. Two model speciﬁcations suggest that properties located in municipalities with commuter rail stations exhibit values that are between 9.6\% and 10.1\% higher than properties in municipalities without a commuter rail station. With a third model we detect weak evidence of the capitalization of auto access time or walking time to the stations, suggesting that properties located within a one-half mile buﬀer of a station have values that are 10.1\% higher than properties located outside of this buﬀer area and that an additional minute of drive time from the station is related to a decrease of 1.6\% in property values. Our results also indicate that proximity to commuter rail right-of-way has a signiﬁcant negative eﬀect on property values, which suggests that for every 1,000 ft. in distance from the commuter rail right-of-way, property values are between \$732 and \$2,897 higher, all else held equal. At the mean sample values, this result translates into an elasticity of between 0.03 and 0.13, depending on the functional form of the hedonic price equation.},

Hedonic regression analysis is typically used to estimate the marginal contribution of these individual characteristics. This study provides a review of recent studies that have used hedonic modeling to estimate house prices.
